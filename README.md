# HeroSpinMobileApp
Sometimes, having too many options can be overwhelming. Weâ€™ve all been there. Restaurants with long menus, a piece of clothing in many different colors, and of course, a quiet evening in front of the TV, not knowing what to watch. Especially with the last one, sometimes it would be great if someone could make that call for us. And since most of us, are also playing with our phone, while in front of the TV (if not also controlling the TV), what could be better than an app, that randomly picks a show for you. Because we are geeks, and we love superheroes, our app is going to be picking random superhero movies. If you really feel like you want to take the situation in your hands, you can select your hero.
